email2certs reads an email message from stdin and writes all S/MIME
certificates found in the email to stdout in PEM format.

To process an entire Berkeley-style mbox file, you can use formail:

	formail -Y -s email2certs < mbox

TODO:
	Greater tolerance of malformed input.
	Look for certs in other places (attachments, inline PEM, etc.)
