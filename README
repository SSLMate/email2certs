smime2ct reads an email message from stdin and submits all S/MIME
certificates found in the email to Certificate Transparency logs (currently
Pilot and Rocketeer).

To process an entire Berkeley-style mbox file, you can use formail:

	formail -Y -s smime2ct < mbox

TODO:
	Allow logs to be specified by user.

	Save the SCTs for later auditing.

	Greater tolerance of malformed input.

	Split into two programs - one that extracts certificates from
	emails and another that submits certs.
